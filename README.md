# HashMap
Portfolio assignment for my Data Structures course at Oregon State University.

I completed the implementation of a hash map using 2 different methods. The first method used is separate chaining where linked lists are used for collision resolution and the underlying structure of the hash table is a dynamic array. The second method used is open addressing with quadratic probing for collision resolution and the underlying structure of the hash table is a dynamic array.
